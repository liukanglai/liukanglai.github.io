视频地址：《美丽中国：长白之山》

Located in the northeast of China the Changbai Mountains is named after its iconic scenery of being perpetually white almost all year long.

长白山位于中国的东北部，因一年四季常年积雪而得名。

These mountains were formed around 2.77 million years ago after volcano eruptions due to the movement of the earth crust.

大约 277 万年前，由于地壳运动导致了火山喷发，形成了这座山脉。

At the top of the main mountain there is a crater lake with an altitude of 2100 meters.

在长白山主峰上有一个海拔 2100 米的火山口湖。

It is called "Tian Chi" in Chinese, literally meaning Heaven Lake.

中文名叫天池。

Its latest eruption happened around 300 years ago.

它最近的一次喷发大概在三百多年前。

Tianchi is the largest crater lake in China, and it is the deepest mountain lake around the world as well.

天池是中国最大的火山湖，也是世界上最深的高山湖泊。

The average depth of water is 204 meters.

平均水深 204 米。

It has stored over 2 billion tons of freshwater, which is able to supply the population in Beijing downtown for 22 months.

储存着超过 20 亿立方米的淡水，可以供应北京城区人口 22 个月的用量。

The winter lasts for 9 months in the Changbai Mountains.

长白山的冬季占了整整九个月。

Thus, the crest of the mountain is covered by snow most of the time.

山顶常年积雪。

The depth of the snow is 50 centimeters on average.

积雪深度一般在 50 厘米。

It is extremely difficult to visit the mountain during the winter.

冬季登上长白山是件极其困难的事。

Lake Tianchi only melts in Mid-July due to the cold weather and the water in the lake is flowing for only 30 days every year.

只有到了每年的七月中旬，冰封的天池才能融化，一年之中只有三十天才有可能见到水波流动的天池。

It is always misty and cloudy.

这里也常年云雾缭绕。

According to the locals, people could only see the most imposing scenery here if they have a special mysterious connection with this 'magical mountain'.

按当地人的说法，只有与这座神山有缘的人才能一睹天池最壮美的景色。
