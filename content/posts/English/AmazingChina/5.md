视频地址：《美丽中国：中国南海的奇绝秘境》

Starting from Hainan Island, the southernmost province of China, you can reach Sansha City at the southern tip, by this transportation supply ship.

从中国最南部的省份海南岛出发，乘坐这艘交通补给船可以前往中国最南端的三沙市。

Sansha is made up of more than 280 islands, sandbars, reefs and other sea areas.

它由大小 280 多个岛屿、沙洲、暗礁以及其它海域组成。

April to May are the most beautiful seasons in this part of China.

每年的 4 月 5 月是这片海最美的季节。

The sea is colorful, with an average visibility of more than 30 meters.

海洋的颜色五彩斑斓，海水平均透明度达到 30 多米。

Looking down from a high altitude, the islands in front of us do not seem to be connected with each other, but they are known as the Seven Connected Islets.

从高空往下看，眼前的这几座小岛似乎彼此并不相连，但它们被称为七连屿。

That's because beneath the sea, there is a huge reef holding them together, forming a common foundation for the little islands.

因为在海面之下有一个巨型礁盘托住了它们，那是七座小岛共同的基座。

As the tide rises and falls, they display a variety of features.

随着潮水起落，它们展现不同的面貌。

Most of the islets here are made up of coral remains.

这里的岛屿大部分都由珊瑚虫的遗骸堆积而成。

Coral secretes limestone, which becomes their living shells.

在新陈代谢中，珊瑚虫会分泌石灰石变为自己生存的外壳。

They gather together and grow and multiply from generation to generation.

它们聚集在一起，一代代生长繁衍。

Layer upon layer of limestone is added and then compacted to form the coral reef we see today.

石灰石不断粘合压实，就成为如今我们看到的珊瑚礁。

This reef is still growing, towards the sea, at a rate of about 2.5 centimeters per year.

这片珊瑚礁如今仍在以每年 2.5 厘米左右的速度向海生长。

视频地址：《美丽中国：圣洁之山 - 稻城亚丁》

Daocheng Yading is a magical and mysterious land located in the southwest of China's Sichuan province.

稻城亚丁是一片神奇并且充满神秘色彩的土地，它位于中国四川省西南部。

This is a kingdom surrounded by breath-taking views of snow-capped mountains, steep glaciers, crystal clear lakes, vast pastures, as well as dense woods.

这是一个令人叹为观止的自然王国，四周环绕着长年积雪的雪山、陡峭的冰川、纯净的湖泊、大片的草地和森林。

It is called the last pure land on this blue planet.

被称为水蓝色星球上最后一片净土。

Every September, the scenery here is at its most fascinating.

每年 9 月这里的景色最为迷人。

It's like placing people into a colorful fairy tale world.

仿佛让人置身彩色的童话世界。

The focal point is the three mountain peaks in Daocheng Yading.

稻城亚丁有三座山峰。

The most beautiful is called Yang Maiyong.

其中最美的当属央迈勇。

It is about 6,000 meters in height, and has the shape of a perfect pyramid.

这座山峰不到 6000 米，形状均匀呈完美锥形金字塔形。

Back in 1931, the American explorer Joseph Rock first introduced it to the world with photos taken for the National Geographic magazine.

1931 年美国探险家约瑟夫 · 洛克首次在国家地理杂志上向全世界介绍了这里。

He wrote, "she is the most beautiful snow peak my eyes have ever seen".

他在日记中写到，她是我见到的世界上最美的山峰。

Next to it, stand two other mountains: Xiannairi and Xianuoduoji.

旁边还耸立着两座山峰，这就是仙乃日和夏诺多吉。

The crest of the mountains is covered by snow most of the time.

三座山峰终年积雪不化。

No one has yet ever been able to reach the top.

至今无人登顶。

They are called the "Three Holy Mountains".

它们被称作 “三神山”。

It is an irreplaceably sacred place in the hearts of the local people.

是当地人民心中不可替代的神圣之地。

The locals say that if one could walk round the holy mountains three times, then your wishes for this life will be fulfilled.

据说若当地人能够朝拜三次神山便能实现今生之所愿。

But it is such a great challenge to both one's physical ability and mind, because of its altitude.

但是由于海拔太高这对于体能和意志都是极大的考验。

What drives them to do that?

是什么在支撑着他们呢？

Perhaps it is simple faith.

也许唯有信仰可以知道答案。

It is not only the last pure land, but also earth that can purify the soul.

这里不仅仅是最后一片净土更有着足以净化心灵的力量。

央视《美丽中国》P7：冰川下的鲜红岩石 - 横断山贡嘎山——双语文字版 - 哔哩哔哩
《Amazing China: Scarlet rocks Under Glaciers》视频地址：《美丽中国：冰川下的鲜红岩石 - 横断山贡嘎山》There is a rare spectacle to be found at the end of the glaciers beneath the main peak of a mountain area in southwestern China. 在中国西南山地的主峰下，冰川的尽头有一种罕见的奇观。
视频地址：《美丽中国：冰川下的鲜红岩石 - 横断山贡嘎山》

There is a rare spectacle to be found at the end of the glaciers beneath the main peak of a mountain area in southwestern China.

在中国西南山地的主峰下，冰川的尽头有一种罕见的奇观。

The surface of the rocks here is an eye catching bright red.

这里的岩石表面颜色鲜红令人无比惊奇。

This is the heart of the Hengduan Mountains, a mountainous region in southwestern China

这是中国西南山地横断山的核心。

145 snowy peaks over 5,000 meters above sea level are clustered here, forming an amazing group of mountains.

145 座海拔 5000 米以上的雪峰就在这里密集地簇立着，形成一片梦幻般的角峰群。

The highest peak, Gongga Mountain, is 7,556 meters above sea level.

其中的最高峰叫贡嘎山，海拔 7556 米。

It is the highest point in the mountainous area of Southwest China.

是中国西南山地的最高点。

Its giant conical peak is the cradle of glacier formation, from which 74 mature glaciers extend in all directions.

它巨大的锥壮主峰正是冰川生成的，中心 74 条成熟的冰川就由此朝着四面八方向下延伸。

The Hailuogou Glacier in the east has a huge icy waterfall measuring 1,100 meters wide, with a drop of more than 1,000 meters.

位于东面的海螺沟冰川，拥有 1100 米宽，落差超过 1000 米的巨大的冰瀑布。

The strong thawing effect leads to frequent massive icy avalanches.

强烈融冻作用让大规模的冰崩几乎成了这里的常态。

Giant glaciers descend all the way into dense forests.

巨大的冰川一路向下深入到茂密的森林中。

With its tip extending to 2,850 meters above sea level, it is the lowest maritime glacier in Asia.

而冰川的末端甚至延伸到了海拔 2850 米处，是亚洲海拔最低的一座海洋性冰川。

Bright red rocks can be seen almost everywhere in the valley at the end of the glacier.

冰川尽头的河谷中几乎随处都能看到鲜红的岩石。

Scientists have found that the red blood color on the stone is not from a mineral, but a rare parasite, a rare lichen complex.

科学家的研究发现，石头上的血红色并非矿物质，而是一种极稀有的寄生生物，一种罕见的地衣的复合体。

Whenever the temperature and humidity are right, they spread across the rock surface, dyeing the rocks bright red.

只要温度和湿度适宜，它们就会在岩石表面肆意生长，把一块块岩石染成鲜红色。

Taken away from the mountains however, they quickly change color and die.

只要被带出大山它们就会迅速变色死去。

Even if they are left in peace, their life span is only four to five years, and then they will regenerate and begin coloring the rocks bright red again.

即便原地不动，它们的寿命也只有四到五年，然后又会再生重新把岩石染红。

Why they came into being has baffled many great minds.

它们究竟因何而生至今仍是未解之谜。

央视《美丽中国》P8：三爿石的故事——双语文字版 - 哔哩哔哩
《Amazing China: The Tectonic Story of Sanpan Stone》视频地址：《美丽中国：三爿石的故事》In China&#39;s southeast coastal......
视频地址：《美丽中国：三爿石的故事》

In China's southeast coastal province of Zhejiang, there is a group of giant rocks called the Sanpan Stone, literally meaning, the three pieces of stone.

位于中国东南沿海的浙江省境内，矗立着一组名叫三爿石的庞然大物，它的字面意思是三片石头。

Once upon a time however they were one whole piece of rock.

不过它曾经是一整块石头。

The story of the Sanpan Stone started 135 million years ago.

三爿石的故事要从 1 亿 3500 万年前说起。

Back then, during a violent tectonic event, powerful forces formed a basin covering nearly 347 square miles.

当时一次强烈的造山运动形成了近 900 平方公里的盆地。

Imagine the basin as a cradle, in which the Sanpan Stone is nestling.

你可以把这个盆地看作是三爿石发育的摇篮。

In this huge bowl, sedimentary rocks gathered, dominated by conglomerates.

在这个巨大的盆地中沉积了以砂砾岩为主的沉积岩群。

These sediments were the origins of the Sanpan Stone.

也就是三爿石的婴儿阶段。

The process of mountain building continued.

后来，当地发生了数次造山运动。

The sediments in the basin were forced up to form a sedimentary massif, which gradually grew into the Sanpan Stone.

盆地中的沉积岩被抬升形成的山体正如成长中的三爿石。

For tens of millions of years, Wind and water eroded the massif along vertical fractures until most of the rock was weathered away.

千万年来风蚀和水蚀沿着山体的垂直节理进行切割。

Eventually the three individual rocks with steep cliffs we see today were formed.

直到把三爿石侵蚀成今天我们看到的样子：陡崖环绕的三座高大孤峰。

The highest of them measures 324 metres.

在这三爿巨石中最高的那块也不过 324 米。

However, the steep cliffs pose a great challenge for those wishing to reach the top.

尽管如此，环绕的陡崖为登顶三爿石增加了难度。

About 500 years ago, in China's Ming Dynasty, a group of carpenters was hired to build a wooden ladder in order to reach the top of the Sanpan Stone.

大约五百年前在明朝年间，曾有人雇佣大批木匠试图塔木梯登顶三爿石。

They toiled for three long years, but failed in their task.

持续了三年的时间还未登顶。

Before the ladder could reach the summit, its foot had rotted away.

而木梯最下面的桩脚已经霉烂。

The ambition of reaching the top was not achieved until the end of 1980s.

人们通过三爿石登天的梦想直到上世纪 80 年代末才完成。

Over 3,500 stone steps were carved into the rock face.

当地人沿着石壁开凿了超过三千五百级台阶。

Now, we can finally climb these steep stairs and reach the top, to experience the power of the tectonic movements from the remote past.

终于人们可以沿着陡峭的阶梯登顶三爿石感受远古大地积蓄的力量。

央视《美丽中国》P9：水天之间的巨型盆景 - 武夷山——双语文字版 - 哔哩哔哩
《Amazing China: Huge Bonsai between Water and Sky》视频地址：《美丽中国：水天之间的巨型盆景 - 武夷山》Wuyi Mountain, located in the southeastern part of China, has a total area of about 1,000 square kilometers. 武夷山位于中国的东南部，总面积约 1000 平方公里。
视频地址：《美丽中国：水天之间的巨型盆景 - 武夷山》

Wuyi Mountain, located in the southeastern part of China, has a total area of about 1,000 square kilometers.

武夷山位于中国的东南部，总面积约 1000 平方公里。

It has the largest nature reserve in Fujian Province, and the largest existing subtropical primary forest system in the same latitude zone in the world.

这里拥有福建省最大的自然保护区，生长着世界同纬度带现存面积最大的亚热带原生性森林系统。

Wuyi Mountain is deeply influenced by a fault zone, which controls the direction of the ridge line.

武夷山深受断裂带的影响，主要断裂控制了山脊线的走向。

The other faults divide the mountain into several fault blocks and form many deep valleys.

其他方向的断裂则把山体分割成若干断块，形成了众多深谷。

The Tongmuguan Fault Zone is the center of the faults, forming a spectacular "V"-shaped grand canyon.

桐木关断裂带就是断裂中心，V 型大峡谷非常壮观。

The intense tectonic movements of millions of years ago gifted Wuyi Mountain a magnificent Danxia landform, which differs from the Danxia landform in Northwest China.

亿万年前剧烈的地壳运动给武夷山带来了壮丽的丹霞地貌，这里与西北的丹霞地貌不同。

Many of the rock surfaces are covered with different shades of vegetation, creating a blush on the huge green mountains.

众多岩石表面覆盖了深浅不一的植被，丹霞就像给庞大的绿色山脉抹上了腮红。

The Goddess Peak, the symbol of Wuyi Mountain, is the typical residual Danxia landform left by the faults.

玉女峰是武夷山的标志，她便是典型的断裂残留型丹霞地貌

Geological movement caused a red-rock massif to collapse under its enormous weight.

地质运动让红岩山体在重力作用下倒坍。

The Goddess Peak is the last remaining pillar of the surrounding rocks after the collapse.

玉女峰就是周边岩石倒坍后残留下来的峰柱。

There are many cracks in the karst rocks of Wuyi Mountain.

武夷山的赤石岩中有许多断裂缝隙。

After millions of years of scouring and cutting by water flowing through them, many streams have been formed around the mountain.

溪水流淌在上面经过千万年的冲刷和切割，形成了水绕山形的溪流。

Sitting on bamboo rafts and following the stream, tourists can enjoy the scenery of Wuyi Mountain along the way.

游客坐在竹筏上顺溪而下，沿途就可以把武夷山的风景尽收眼底。

视频地址：《美丽中国：中国的彩虹山》

In Northwestern China, there is a chain of undulating hills called Colorful Zhangye Danxia.

在中国的西北，内陆有一片波浪起伏的丘陵被称作张掖七彩丹霞。

Here you can find the colors of the rainbow.

在这里，你能找到彩虹的颜色。

The terrain is so hostile that even grass struggles to survive.

在这些岩石上只有一些草在艰难生长。

So where did this palette of colors come from?

那么这些七彩的颜色究竟从何而来？

It's hard to imagine, but this area was once a lake.

很难想象这里曾是一片湖。

The multi-colored hills are the result of the long geological evolution of the lakebed.

眼前的七彩丘陵是湖底经漫长的地质演变而来。

Changes in temperature and humidity, as well as the existence of various mineral elements, and the differing iron content in lake sediments especially, gave rise to the spectrum of colors.

气候的干湿冷暖变化和不同矿物质元素的存在，尤其是湖泊沉积物的含铁量差异，赋予了丘陵层次分明的韵律。

Part of the ancient Silk Road, it is said that Marco Polo once visited here over 700 years ago.

古丝绸之路从这里穿过，据说马可波罗也曾到访此地。

However, compared to Marco Polo, today we can have much more fun.

不过，比起 700 多年前的马可波罗，今天的我们也许多了一些乐趣。

视频地址：《美丽中国：西湖》

There are no less than 30 lakes named "West Lake" in China.

在中国 以西湖命名的湖泊有不下 30 个。

But the West Lake in Hangzhou is the best known of them all.

但是真正称得上是家喻户晓的只有杭州西湖。

It is located in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province on the southeastern coast.

她位于中国东南沿海浙江省的省会杭州。

And the city is known as the Paradise of the World in China.

一座在国内被誉为人间天堂的城市。

Thousands of years ago, the West Lake was connected to the sea.

数千年前西湖曾与大海相连。

The Qiantang River, not far away from the West Lake,enters the sea in the eastern part of this area.

不远处的钱塘江正是在这片水域的东部入海。

Sediment deposited by the river eventually blocked the connection between the West Lake and the sea, making it an inland water feature.

江水带来的泥沙不断淤积，最终阻隔了西湖与大海的联系，让这里成为内陆湖泊。

Since the 9th century A.D., the beautiful scenery of the West Lake in all seasons has appeared time and again in poems, stories and legends.

自公元 9 世纪以来，西湖美景在四季轮转中装载了越来越多得诗篇故事与传说。

It's roughly estimated there are about 630 legends of the West Lake alone.

据不完全统计，仅西湖的传说就有约六百三十余个。

In 2011 West Lake Cultural Landscape of Hangzhou was included on the World Heritage List.

2011 年杭州西湖文化景观被列入世界遗产名录。

It is visited by an endless stream of international tourists.

慕名而来的国际游客络绎不绝。

Perhaps some of them will add their own stories to West Lake's wealth of literature.

也许，他们将为西湖续写更为多元的故事。

视频地址：《美丽中国：是牛还是羊?》

Deep in central China's Qinling Mountains, there are some mysterious wild animals in the untraversed area.

秦岭山脉人迹罕至的地方总会有一些神秘的珍稀野生动物。

Meet takin.

比如羚牛。

It is perhaps one of the largest mammals on earth that many people have never heard of.

它们也许是地球上许多人没有听说过的，体型最大的哺乳动物之一。

Without using drone, it's impossible to trace them and got this rare footage.

如果不是使用无人机，我们很难一睹它们的尊容。

Local conservationists said that they haven't seen these enigmatic creatures for more than a decade.

当地的动物保护者们表示，已经有十几年没有看见这些神奇动物了。

These animals live in an inaccessible area at the altitude of 2,500 meters above sea level.

秦岭羚牛生活在海拔 2500 米以上的无人山区，神出鬼没。

Many people may think that takin is a kind of cow, because they are thick and strong,and adult individuals can even be as high as 2 meters or more.

很多人误以为羚牛是一种牛，因为它们体型粗壮，成年的个体甚至能高达 2 米以上。

In fact, takins are not cows.

事实上，羚牛不是牛。

They are closer to the family of goat antelope, with a pair of small horns, and the sound is similar to that of the antelope.

从亲缘关系上它们和羊更接近，有一对小型的角，叫声也和羊差不多。

They are alert to the looming appearance of drone, so when the drone approach them, we need to keep a friendly and safe distance with them.

它们对无人机的贸然出现表示警觉，所以见到它们的时候我们保持了友好的安全距离。

Now it is time for lunch.

现在正是它们觅食的时候。

Let's hope our takin friends to have a good meal!

祝我们的羚牛朋友们能饱餐一顿！
