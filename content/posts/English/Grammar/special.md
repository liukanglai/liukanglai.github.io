---## 强调句型

1. 构成

- it is ... that(可人可物)/who ...

      It was I that met my old flame in the street yesterday.

> only use is and was

- it is that 什么成分都不充当，可以去掉
- 主语从句不能去掉

2. 应用

- 作文中任何一句话都可以写成强调句型

## 虚拟语气

1. 虚假，主观

2. 用法

- 只需要把写好的句子时态变为过去即可。
- 在虚拟语气中，be 动词的过去式只有 were, would = could = might.

```
If you are a tear in my eye, I will never shed it.
If you were a tear in my eye, I would never shed it.

If I was a tear in your eye, I could stay with you forever.
If I has been a tear in your eye, I could have stayed with you forever.(情态动词无过去式，后面必加原型)
```

- 对将来的虚拟：主句 would/could/might + do(同现在的虚拟)，从句是 were to do 或者 should do.

3. 特殊用法

- 以下，从句：should + 动词原型，should 可省略

```
以防：in case that, for fear that, least ...
命：order, direct, command ...
贱：suggest, advise, propose
要求：ask, request, require, demand ...
是必要：It is necessary/important/urgent that ...
```

- 时态倒推原则，往后一个原则
  wish, if only, but for, or/otherwise, as if/as though

      I wish I would(will) be ...
      If only I were more ... than others.

- would rather do sth(不是虚拟语气，宁愿做某事) would rather not do
- would rather sb did(对现在的虚拟，变过去式)
- would rather sb had down

- It is high time(that) + 过去式 表示虚拟

4. 应用

- It is high time that the issue about social moral were the focus of public attention.
- My suggestion is that kids should be encouraged to take part in more activities, developing a sense of competition.

## (部分)倒装

1. 把一句话写成一般疑问句的形式，也就是给一句话提个助动词，放在句首

2. 用法：

- 否定词放句首，后面倒装

```
I have never been to other countries except Japan.
Never have I been to other countries except Japan.

She seldom takes a shower in winter.
Seldom does she take a shower in winter.

Under no circumstance could ...
```

- so 表肯定，nor/neither 表否定位于句首，表明承前句子的肯定或否定时用倒装

      My husband can speak Japanese. I can speak Japanese, too. (so can I)
      I cannot dance well. My daughter cannot dance either. (neither can my daughter)

- so ... that 的倒装(形容词，副词多)，so 引导的句子放前，用倒装

      He was so excited that he cannot help laughing at midnight.(从句一定是陈述句)
      So excited was he ...
      He is giving a speech so forcefully that everyone present is convinced.
      So forcefully is he giving ...

- only + 状语!!!，位于句首 (only you do I love. wrong)

- as 引导的让步状语从句的倒装：adj/adv 分词/名词(前面不能加冠词)放句首，后加 as 引导的状语从句

```
Ugly as I look, I am quite gentle.
Simple as the drawing seems, the meaning behind it is far-reaching.

Happily as we stay together, I would not like to see him again.
Much as I love my mother, I cannot agree with her.

Old man as he is(no a), I cannot forgive his bad behavior.
```

- 省略 if 的虚拟语气用倒装

      If you were a tear in my eye, I would never shed it.
      Were you a ...

      Had I be a ...
      Should I be ...

3. 应用

写作：

- 有形容词和副词，用 so 倒装。
- only when will we 常用
- ... as ...

长难句分析：

- 先还员倒装，再分析

## 插入语

1. 常见

- 副词。。。 Respecting parents, undoubtely, keeps a traditional Chinese virtue.
- 介词短语。。。
- 不定式短语
- 分句
- 现在分词
